**PseKill**

Simple bash script to terminate a process. Uses the original kill command with escalating priority. The script searched the ps Aux output for a process matching the input value. On more than one possible result will ask to specify and exit. Also accepts pid values.

**instructions**

Nothing you don't already know, Add the script to a directory in your $PATH. If you change the scripts filename you must also change it on line no. 22

Good riddance!

**to note**

This is a project simply for the sake of exploratory learning. There are a couple of tasks I have set out for my self
 - in Script prompting of specifying process when multiple options are present
 - Adding options to change PathName length
 - See if I can delimit pathName length by other means that character amount.
